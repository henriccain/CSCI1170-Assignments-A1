### As a student of CSCI1170, I was placed with the task of creating a website using strictly HTML. I chose the option of creating a news-like website. I made the first page and named it “index.html” like as directed. I created the required html structure, adding a header with a title, navigation with links, and a body with pictures and links to the articles, and finally a footer with contact information. I divided each container and its content in it with containers to further the organisation. I then proceeded to create the pages for the articles, proceeding with the required information. Lastly, I created a “readme.md” file for this purpose specifically. In total, I am proud of this site, and I’m excited to use CSS to improve the layout!
